# N3X

Extension of Notation3 (N3) with SPARQL expressions.

## Contents

- `eval/`: Contains examples from [EYE](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/
) rewritten in N3X and some evaluation.
- `parser/`: Contains a small CLI tool for parsing Turtle, N3 and N3X. 
  The grammars are provided in Parser Expression Grammar in the `.pest` files in `parser/src/`.

## Support

If you want to help me with my work on N3X do not hesitate to file an issue.

Furthermore, I prepared a small [questionnaire about N3 and details of N3X](https://forms.gle/t51u3jS1kNK9UyYa9). 
I'd highly appreciate if you find the time to answer the questions.
